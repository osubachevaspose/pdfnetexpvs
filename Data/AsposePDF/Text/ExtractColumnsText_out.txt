                                                Sample PDF File 1 –                     Page 1  

                  This is a sample text on page one in PDF file in which the text replacement is to be performed.  
                   
                  In order to replace text in all the pages of a PDF document, you first need to use TextFragmentAbsorber 
                  to find the particular phrase you want to replace. After that, you need to go through all the 
                  TextFragments to replace the text and change any other attributes. Once you have done that, you only 
                  need to save the output PDF using Save method of the Document object. The example elaborates this in 
                  detail to replace text in a PDF document.
